# UD1Sodas Website repository
## IMAT2207 Agile Team Development module project

UD1Sodas is an e-commerce site that aims to sell imported soda drinks to the general public.  
Written using C# and Microsoft SQL, we have created both a backend system that processes orders, customer & staff information and stock inventory data.  
A web-based user frontend is also created by us for use by the customers to sign up with their information, place orders and place items in a virtual basket for large orders.  

More documentation can be found in the /docs/ subdirectory..
